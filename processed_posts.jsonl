But how do You know that developing and implementing AI is the way to go?\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about impact assessment!\n\nThere are a few things I usually consider when thinking about implementation of AI (or any project really):\n\n\n1 - Can the problem be solved without AI?\n\nAlways start with the simpler solution if possible.\n\nWhy? \n\nA simpler solution is faster to implement and more certain to work as intended.\n\nA solution based on rules is fully transparent and understandable; You coded the rules Yourself!\n\nEven if a more advanced model turns out to be the optimal solution, the simpler implementation has most likely provided valuable lessons about the data and problem.\n\n\n2 - Estimate Cost\n\nThe cost of developing and implementing AI varies a lot depending on the problem and how ready the rest of the setup is. \n\n - Need to collect the data first?\n - Is the setup mature enough to run AI solutions in production?\n - How is the output going to be used?\n\nCreating a model for supervised learning on a structured dataset and exposing the results in an API can probably be done in a few weeks.\n\nDeveloping a setup with data collection, storage, ETL pipelines, models and frontend will take much longer.\n\nEstimating cost is even more important for early stage startups, as cost and opportunity cost are closely related. Spending time developing AI means not working on another - potentially more crucial - solution.\n\n\n3 - Project Uncertainty\n\nHow certain are we that we\u2019ll actually solve the problem in a satisfactory way? \n\nSome problems, like recommendation systems, have been implemented many times and are fairly likely to be solvable with the right data. \nEstimating development time and cost can be done with some degree of certainty.\n\nWant to use a time series analysis for a non-standard use case on a dataset with tons of weird interaction effects?\nMight take a few months just to investigate if that is even possible. \n\n\n4 - Estimate Business Value\n\nEverything comes down to the business case.\nThis is no different from making any business decision whether it\u2019s hiring, marketing, development or something else.\n\nLeave some room for errors here. The solution should be estimated to bring home significantly more than its development cost.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn summary: If a solution is fairly straightforward and almost certain to bring more value than its implementation cost, go ahead and get it done!\n\n\nWhat are Your considerations when scoping a new project?"}

Be like Mads Misiak Friis!\n\n\n\nHave you ever considered working with a coach?\n\nI first met Mads back in 2018 when I\u2019d just finished my Master in Physics. I had signed up for a course focusing on how to build a startup, a course Mads was instructing.\n\nHe stood out as an incredibly open and friendly character radiating positive energy, while still having the no bullshit attitude you need when making rational decisions for your startup's trajectory.\n\nSo naturally, when I saw that Mads was arranging a weekend related to everything startup, health and goal setting, I had to join. The weekend turned into 3 months of coaching from which I\u2019ve benefited immensely!\n\n\nWe\u2019ve worked on several interesting topics:\n\n - Transitioning from a permanent position to freelancing; what to do when selling yourself in for a new project\n\n - Focusing on what makes you happy and removing stuff that does not\n\n - Eating healthier and increasing performance in work and private life\n\n - Balancing how to weigh financial outcomes with the mental capacity spent on projects and during negotiating\n\n\n\nI think that everyone who has the opportunity should try it out at least once during their career.\n\nHave a great day!"}

In a real-world scenario, a model would know nothing about how Covid impacts variables in a dataset. If it caused a data drift in any variable, there's a big chance that model performance will drop. \nThis performance drop is not noticeable when splitting data randomly, due to all datasets containing data points from all points in time.\n\nFix this by using a sliding time window when estimating model performance, where T_train < T_test.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Overfitting Hyperparameters:\n\nHyperparameter tuning is an essential step in optimizing machine learning models. However, it's easy to fall into the trap of overfitting these hyperparameters. This mistake is often compounded by extensive grid searches or automated hyperparameter optimization techniques without proper cross-validation. This creates a model with great performance on the test set, that probably is NOT the best model for generalization. Wojtek Kuberski recently highlighted this in his excellent post.\n\nPrevent this by using tools like k-fold cross-validation during hyperparameter tuning to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Not monitoring models post-deployment:\n\nModel performance often deteriorates over time. This is primarily due to changes in the underlying data distributions.\nWithout regular checks, significant performance drops can go unnoticed until it's too late, leading to overconfidence in the model's abilities based on its initial evaluation metrics.\n\nCombat this by implementing a robust monitoring system that can detect performance changes or data drift and trigger retraining or model evaluation processes."}
