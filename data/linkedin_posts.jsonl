Chatbots can answer a lot of the easier questions and offload customer support personnel.\n\nA chatbot I have personally found helpful is the one Visma Dinero has implemented. It is super useful to have some help at hand for someone like me, who does not know that much about bookkeeping.\n\n\nCreate a Recommendation System\n\nRecommendation systems are widely used in online shops and on streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify.\nThe algorithms ensure that a movie or song that You are likely to also like is recommended.\nGood for optimizing revenue per customer as related items are displayed in addition to what someone is looking to buy already.\n\n\nCustomer Profiling\n\nKnowing Your ideal customer profile greatly improves the understanding of how to market a product correctly.\nHow old are they? What do they do? Are they individuals or corporate? Thorough analysis of the customer profile is a key part of targeted ads and ensures reaching out to the right people when selling.\n\n\nOutlier Detection\n\nAre You unsure whether an event is a statistical fluke or should be acted upon?\nUnderstanding this can be crucial in decision making.\nOutlier detection is often used in finance to identify fraudulent transactions or monitor stock market anomalies.\n\n\n\nUnsure of how to get going with any of the above?\n\nLet us have an informal chat."}
{"prompt": "Create a LinkedIn post using the language and tone of Mikkel Jensen. The post is about Four things You should do before developing ML & AI models",
"completion": "Four things You should do before developing ML & AI models:\n\n1: Create the data foundation\n\nYou‚Äôve probably heard the phrase ‚Äúdata is the new gold‚Äù a bunch of times by now. And in case of developing ML & AI solutions that certainly is the case in many instances. \nYour data is what is unique to your business. Make sure it‚Äôs structured and continuously gathered.\n\n\n2: Make a data quality overview\n\nIn Data Science there‚Äôs a saying: ‚ÄúGarbage in, Garbage out‚Äù. Your models are only as good as the data you provide for them. Make sure that this data is as good as possible before potentially building a model on faulty data.\n\n\n3: Analyze and visualize your data\n\nBasic statistical analysis and visualization highlights many important factors about Your data. This will probably answer most business questions and prevent wasting time on building a fancy solution for a simple problem.\n\n\n4: Implement basic automation\n\nA lot of tasks that are thought to be solvable with ML & AI can be boiled down to hard coded decision making algorithms. The advanced tools shine when there are loads of complex patterns and many features in the dataset.\nIf You have a few features and know how to make a rule based system from Your expert knowledge, chances are that this system will be as good as more advanced methods. \nIt's a huge benefit having a fully transparent decision making tool, plus the development faster in most cases and thus less risky from a business perspective.\n\n\nI‚Äôve heard the same store so many times:\n\n‚ÄúWe want to use Generative AI & LLMs to do X, although we‚Äôre not sure where to start‚Äù\n\nStart with the four above and You‚Äôll be in a great position to leverage Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWhat did I miss?"}

{"prompt": "Create a LinkedIn post using the language and tone of Mikkel Jensen. The post is highlighting three mistake that people often make when estimating model performance.",
"completion": "üåü Three mistakes that makes you overestimate model performance üåü \n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Not realizing that data is in fact a time series:\n\nEven though data points might seem independent of each other, they can have some non-trivial connection when collected over time.\nRandomly splitting train, test, & validation data that emerges from a time series enables overestimation of model performance. \n\nA great example of this is Covid-19's impact on datasets. In a real-world scenario, a model would know nothing about how Covid impacts variables in a dataset. If it caused a data drift in any variable, there's a big chance that model performance will drop. \nThis performance drop is not noticeable when splitting data randomly, due to all datasets containing data points from all points in time.\n\nFix this by using a sliding time window when estimating model performance, where T_train < T_test.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Overfitting Hyperparameters:\n\nHyperparameter tuning is an essential step in optimizing machine learning models. However, it's easy to fall into the trap of overfitting these hyperparameters. This mistake is often compounded by extensive grid searches or automated hyperparameter optimization techniques without proper cross-validation. This creates a model with great performance on the test set, that probably is NOT the best model for generalization. Wojtek Kuberski recently highlighted this in his excellent post.\n\nPrevent this by using tools like k-fold cross-validation during hyperparameter tuning to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Not monitoring models post-deployment:\n\nModel performance often deteriorates over time. This is primarily due to changes in the underlying data distributions.\nWithout regular checks, significant performance drops can go unnoticed until it's too late, leading to overconfidence in the model's abilities based on its initial evaluation metrics.\n\nCombat this by implementing a robust monitoring system that can detect performance changes or data drift and trigger retraining or model evaluation processes."}

Some of my main takeaways are:\n\nGive honest and sincere appreciation:\nEveryone wants to feel good about themselves. If you are the person that makes it happen, they‚Äôll also feel good about you.\n\nTalk in terms of the other person‚Äôs interests:\nPeople are rarely convinced to collaborate solely because it‚Äôs beneficial to you.

"completion": "I‚Äôm turning 30 today!\n \nNot that I‚Äôm writing a post to highlight my birthday, but rather as an opener for a stream of thoughts üß†\n \nI never made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, the World's Youngest Billionaires or whatever all the hottest lists are called. And that is completely fine. Most people don‚Äôt üò±\n \nWhat really does matter to me is that I can see changes and improvements on a personal and professional level when looking back a few years. Some of my highlights are:\n \n- I have learned a lot by working with all the great and talented people at Risika for the past two years. I truly believe that this will turn out to be very beneficial for the rest of my career.\n\n- I joined Longship Invest almost two and a half years ago and have gained knowledge about building your own company and being responsible for a lot of thing yourself, even in areas with very little expertise. This has also been mutually beneficial for my work both at Risika and Cyroinvest, as I have been able to use skills from the two companies to improve my knowledge and work in general.\n\n- I recently started working on a new project with Ole Busborg Jensen, which I will be talking more about in the future.\n \n\n\nEvery once in a while take the time to think about what drives you and what makes you happy. ü§î\n\nIf there are some things that you want to do, start doing it.\nAnd if you feel stuck and can‚Äôt see your way out don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help.\n\nEveryone has their own idea of what is important to them. Make sure to pursue those ideas.\n\nI hope that you all have a fantastic day! ü•≥\n\n \nWe‚Äôll wrap things up with a photo from the Risika office\nhashtag#work hashtag#career "}

{"prompt": "Create a LinkedIn post using the language and tone of Mikkel Jensen. The post is about landing your first data science job after finishing studies and why it can be tough. It's also about matching data science job expectations with reality.",
"completion": "Landing your first data science job after finishing a masters degree can be hard. It took me around six months!\n\nA lot of people get into data science nowadays for machine learning (and for good reason, it's an exciting field), and expect the first job to be something along the lines of tinkering with neural network architectures and optimizing parameters and hyperparameter for the specific use case. \nLet me tell you a secret: The jobs where those are the only tasks are few and far between! And while they certainly do exist the competition is pretty tough, as holders of PhDs and Postdocs in machine learning will be applying as well.\n\nIn most businesses the objective will be to maximize value in the most efficient way, regardless of how boring and unsexy the solution might be. I'm still trying to master this skill as I believe it's the most important one.\n\nIf you are just getting started with a career in data science:\n- Have a solid foundation: Python, SQL, statistics\n- Use the simplest solution possible to get the job done\n- Learn how to develop the full solution: Developing a model is good, doing the entire model pipeline is great!\n\nWhat are your most important lessons transitioning into a data science job?\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTalking data science, credit risk, cryptocurrency, software development - Connect & start the conversation!\n\nhashtag#machinelearning hashtag#python hashtag#datascience hashtag#data"}

{"prompt": "Create a LinkedIn post using the language and tone of Mikkel Jensen. The post is about what we're doing in Cyroinvest to beat the market and is posted during a crypto bear market.",
"completion": "As many have noticed, the Crypto market is bleeding these days. At the time of writing one Bitcoin is worth approximately 22.500$, a price level not seen since December 2020.\nThis is a special price for me personally, as it is the price where I ‚Äúbought in‚Äù using the algorithm that I designed for Longship Invest, the algorithmic trading company that I am a partner in.\nI am, of course, a customer in my own company. How can you expect others to use your product if you don‚Äôt believe in it yourself?\n\nAnd how is the investment doing you might ask?\nCurrently I am sitting around 26% above my initial investment üí∞\n\nIs it the insane returns of 10x and 100x everyone has heard and fantasised about in Crypto? No.\nDid I wish that the trading strategy had performed better in the latest downturn? Yes.\n\nIt should be noted that the investment had more than doubled at one point. The trading strategy is unfortunately not fully decoupled from market conditions and is still subject to the large volatility of Crypto, a challenge that we are aiming to improve on with new and better trading strategies üìà \n\nOn the contrary Bitcoin is down around 67% from the top, which is far more than the 44% decrease I have been experiencing. And even though this is still a big drawdown, I believe that Crypto lovers are used to far worse conditions.\n\nIn Longship Invest we have three main goals with the product:\n - Make it easy to get into Crypto using a trading strategy ‚úÖ\n - Decrease volatility and increase Sharpe ratio of investments üÜô\n - Beat the market (Bitcoin) over a period of 5 years üí∏\n\nWe will never be able to beat getting lucky and hitting a moonshot alt coin. But I think that we can come a long way with solid statistics and fully automated trading software, reducing errors introduced by humans and decisions made from bad judgment and from having paper hands. \n\nhashtag#statistics hashtag#investment hashtag#cryptocurrency hashtag#bitcoin hashtag#trading"}
